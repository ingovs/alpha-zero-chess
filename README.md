# alpha-zero-chess ♟️
A from-scratch implementation of AlphaZero for Chess, built for learning.

alpha-zero-chess is an educational project that reconstructs the AlphaZero algorithm using Python, PyTorch, and NumPy.

The goal is to learn the underlying mechanics behind the model described in the paper and to provide a well documented code that helps the understanding of the process.
